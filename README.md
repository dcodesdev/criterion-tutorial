# Rust Sorting Benchmark with Criterion.rs

This repository contains a benchmark comparing the performance of a custom Merge Sort implementation with Rust's built-in `sort` function. We use Criterion.rs to measure and analyze the performance of these sorting algorithms.

## Benchmark Overview

The benchmark evaluates two sorting algorithms:

- **Merge Sort**: A custom implementation of merge sort.
- **Rust's Built-in Sort**: The standard sorting function provided by Rust's `Vec`.

The purpose of this benchmark is to provide insights into the performance of the custom merge sort compared to the highly optimized built-in sort.

### Files

- **`sort_benchmarks.rs`**: Contains the implementation of both sorting algorithms and the benchmarking setup.

## How to Run the Benchmark

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dcodesdev/criterion-tutorial
   cd criterion-tutorial
   ```

2. Run the benchmarks:

   ```bash
   cargo bench
   ```

3. View the detailed HTML reports generated by Criterion.rs in the `target/criterion/report/index.html`.

## About Criterion.rs

Criterion.rs is a powerful and statistically rigorous benchmarking framework for Rust that makes it easy to write performance tests and compare the results.
